> In other words, we will allow AI agents to influence our thoughts and guide our behaviors. When used for good, this could be an amazing form of empowerment, but when abused it could easily become the ultimate tool of persuasion.

Talks around this paper...


[**AI's new power of persuasion: it can change your mind**](https://actu.epfl.ch/news/ai-s-new-power-of-persuasion-it-can-change-your-mi/)

> A new EPFL study has demonstrated the persuasive power of Large Language Models, finding that participants debating GPT-4 with access to their personal information were far more likely to change their opinion compared to those who debated humans.

> The models have learnt through online patterns that a certain way of making an argument is more likely to lead to a persuasive outcome. They have read many millions of Reddit, Twitter and Facebook threads, and been trained on books and papers from psychology about persuasion. **It’s unclear exactly how a model leverages all this information but West believes this is a key direction for future research.**

[**AI Is Becoming More Persuasive Than Humans**](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/emotional-behavior-behavioral-emotions/202403/ai-is-becoming-more-persuasive-than-humans)

**Key points**

- A new study reported that AI could be more persuasive than human persuaders.
- A Large Language Model with access to demographic data successfully used that data to personalize messaging.
- This model was statistically more persuasive than humans when discussing a number of topics.
- Real-world examples of succesful personalizing of messages abound.
