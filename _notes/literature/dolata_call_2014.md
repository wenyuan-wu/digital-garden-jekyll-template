M.D.'s first paper during PhD? Seems like a good start as a literature review...

## What is the summary of the paper?


The paper is a literature review that addresses harmony-related issues in creative teams. It also includes a summary of an exploratory study that confirms the results of the literature review. The paper discusses the implications of these findings for research and work practices, and identifies a practical gap in the field of CSS/GSS, contributing to a better understanding of processes in creative teams.

## What is the research question? (How) was it answered?


The research questions are not explicitly stated in the context. However, it can be inferred that the study is investigating harmony-related issues in creative teams and the needs of innovation and creative teams in relation to information systems. These questions were answered through a literature review, an exploratory study, and observations made within a specific organizational context.

## What research approach did the authors choose? Is it appropriate for achieving the chosen research objective?


The authors chose a Design Science Research (DSR) approach for their study. This involved conducting a rigorous literature review, formulating a working hypothesis, and then evaluating this hypothesis based on observations made during an exploratory study. Given the context, this approach seems appropriate for achieving the research objective as it allows for a comprehensive understanding of the topic and the development of a harmony-oriented model of creative performance.

## What are the key findings of the article? What are the implications?


The key findings of the article are that there is a practical gap in the field of CSS / GSS, particularly in relation to harmony, tensions or conflicts in creative teams within an organizational context. The article also contributes to a better understanding of processes in creative teams. The implications are that further research is needed in this area, particularly in the context of creativity and innovation. The article also suggests that practical evidence can be gained through the implementation of the proposed model of team harmony in real teams.

## What are the limitations of the article? How might future work build on this article?


The limitations of the article include an incomplete literature review and a primary focus on teams in organizational contexts, excluding research done in classes or labs. Future work could build on this article by implementing the proposed model of team harmony in real teams and by taking a closer look at the fields of CSS and GSS. Additionally, future research could investigate harmony issues in the context of creativity and innovation.
