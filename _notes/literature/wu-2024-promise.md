## Abstract

The advent of increasingly powerful language models has raised expectations for conversational interactions. However, controlling these models is a challenge, emphasizing the need to be able to investigate the feasibility and value of their application. We present PROMISE (Available at: <https://github.com/zhaw-iwi/promise>), a framework that facilitates the development of complex conversational interactions with information systems. Its use of state machine modeling concepts enables model-driven, dynamic prompt orchestration across hierarchically nested states and transitions. This improves the control of language modelsâ€™ behavior and thus enables their effective and efficient use. We show the applications of PROMISE in health information systems and demonstrate its ability to handle complex interactions.
