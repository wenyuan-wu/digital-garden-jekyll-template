title: Workshop Persuasion for Chatbot Design
---

This note is about the persuasiveness for chatbot design, as well as a summary of the workshop that took place between M.D., G.S. and R.W. on 2023-12-06.

Content of the workshop:
- Design content for the chatbot
- Provide input as sample interactions with the chatbot
    - (possibly with further notes on what is important in these examples)
- Theories on persuasive and elicitative communication (between people)
- Brainstorming & Discussions

## Perspective from applied psychology/psychiatry

The following points are ==design elements (?)== for the chatbot to achieve persuasion to some extent, many of them are suggested by I.V., who is a psychotherapist. A.S. also contributed a few.

### Inclusion of health literacy and educational content

This is rather straightforward. One important factor for persuasiveness in terms of the chatbot design is to provide accurate but uncomplicated health information. If the user is well-informed about the situation, she/he will most likely be less worried and motivated to "be persuaded".

The health literacy agent in the DC's design serves the same purpose, the question is how we realize this. From what I understand, we have a knowledge lexicon as an external database. This should ==already== be integrated into the chatbot, right?

### Frequency over duration: incremental behavioral adjustment with time-sensitive scheduling

The idea behind "frequency over duration", is that the behavioral change should take place in small increment steps. In the context of therapy planning, e.g., the HCP can encourage the patient to walk for 5 mins at the beginning to make the change happen, then increase the duration of the walking over time. The location of walking can also be arranged in this way, such as first walk at home, then the staircase, then in the yard/garden, then to the park/forest nearby...

The idea emphasizes the importance of doing instead of being demotivated by some big goals at the start. "You should walk 1 hour each day" could be ambitious but not carried out in reality. ==How to implement this into chatbot needs further research==.

### Implementation of sustained motivational reinforcement

"Motivational reinforcement" can be as simple as phrases like "You are doing good!", "You did a good job!", or "I'm proud of you!". Such repeated expressions could help users build confidence and stick to the current therapy plan. So this concept itself is very intuitive, and should be easy to implement to chatbot (or not?).

### Providing psychological support after relationship formation

"After relationship formation" talks about an ideal/predicted situation, in which the user has used the chatbot for a certain period, suggesting that the chatbot is consistent and competent enough to make the user have interactions with it frequently and build relationships upon. Based on this assumption, the chatbot should have the ability to provide some psychological support in case the user is seeking it. Building relationships with users is challenging for a chatbot, but it is certainly an interesting goal to achieve.

### Persuasive communication

As the name suggests, this section is about persuasive communication. As for the question, of how to incorporate persuasive communication into the chatbot, still needs further research...

### Using Metaphor

This is suggested by A.S., to use metaphor to persuade. Metaphor from [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/writing-for-impact/202311/want-to-be-persuasive-find-a-metaphor):

- When you communicate an idea with a metaphor, you light up people’s sensory and motor neurons.
- You also activate emotions, prompt aha moments, and reward your audience with a sense of social interaction.
- When you’re trying to persuade, you might first seek a good story, but you may do better to seek a metaphor.
