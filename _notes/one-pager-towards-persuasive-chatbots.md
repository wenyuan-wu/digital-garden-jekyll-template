## Working Title: Towards Persuasive Chatbots with LLMs


### General Description

The primary goal of the research paper is to create and evaluate prompts to make a LLM-powered chatbot persuasive. The prompts are derived from various research publications from different domains and evaluated by a working prototype. The research follows the design science research method and makes a contribution to practice by providing a new and effective artifact for a real-world problem. 

### Research Objective/Questions

The main research question is ==how can we make a chatbot persuasive==. The term [[chatbot|chatbot]] set the limit of the research scope, which is the text-based [[conversational-agent|conversational agents]] powered by [[llm|LLMs]]. To alter the models is not easily feasible and the way to interact with LLM has predominantly shifted into [[prompt-engineering|prompt engineering]], which is the design *(noun)* in context of DSR, hence this paper treats ==prompts als design artifacts==. 

### Expected Outcomes

- Innovative *artifacts* to make a chatbot persuasive
- Examplary *prompts* to be implemented in a chatbot design
- A set of useful design practices for a chatbot with persuasive abilities
- ==#TODO: add more?==

### Necessary Data/Measurements

The *artifacts (prompts)* are derived from various literature resources. Many research papers and publications in the domain of persuasive communication, psychology and psychiatry have developed a wide range of techniques and factors which could be implemented in chatbot design. 

### Intended Analysis

This paper will try to follow a typical DSR iterative process with 6 steps or elements as shown in the followings.

==#TODO: Demonstration/Evaluation need to be discussed==

#### 1. Problem Identification and Motivation

**Problem statement:** the rapid development of conversational AI (LLMs) fostered the incorporation of the chatbot into consumer products, business services and profession workflows. However, how to make a chatbot persuasive is not fully researched in the context of prompt engineering. This research paper tries to bridge the gap by creating and evaluating artifacts to make a LLM-powered chatbot persuasive.  

#### 2. Define Objectives for a Solution

Objectives of a solution: through text-based interaction, the chatbot should has the persuasive ability to drive the counter-part (the user) to the desired outcome, more specifically, to enable expected change of behaviors. 

#### 3. Design and Development

The off-the-shelf one: a table with persuasive technologies and prompts based upon. 

A technical prototype can also be developed, this can either be an implementation of [[wu_promise_2023|PROMISE framework]], or a quick one based on OpenAI (assistent) API with steamlit to show off.

#### 4. Demonstration

The artifact is used to demonstrate how it solves one or more instances of the problem. The demonstration serves as a ==proof of concept==. 

The table of prompts (off-the-shelf one): the demonstration can be some examples of conversations between chatbot and user. 

The technical one: this can also be put online, hosted on streamlit, netify, etc.

#### 5. Evaluation

This can involve empirical tests, simulations, case studies, analysis, or experiments. 

==#TODO: how to conduct experiment? Due to time limit, a small online experiment with surveys can be conducted, assuming a working prototype is developed. Or is it necessary?==.

#### 6. Communication

The process, its results, and its contributions are communicated to both academic and practical audiences (DC project). 

### Target Community

DSR community is the target, because this research paper is planned to be submitted to [[desrist|DESRIST 2024]], the conference on [[moc-dsr|Design Science Research]]. The theme of conference encourages the DSR community to contemplate DSR-studies from an innovative and pragmatically useful perspective for contributing to a resilient future. The paper could also potentially be interested to the community of [[prompt-engineering|Prompt Engineering]] and [[moc-conversational-ai|Conversational AI]].
