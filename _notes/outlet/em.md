- [Guidelines System](https://www.editorialmanager.com/elma/default2.aspx)

Electronic Markets invites scholars with expertise in the topic areas of electronic markets and networked business to submit a Fundamentals paper to a recent topic of their choice.

Fundamentals is a section that aims to structure recent topics of interest in the fields of electronic markets and networked business. They should offer an understanding of the topic’s relevance, its main characteristics, a definition, examples as well as an outlook. In contrast to research papers, papers submitted to the “Fundamentals” section should primarily structure existing knowledge and offer guidance, e.g. by proposing a framework based on existing research.

Before submitting a Fundamentals paper, authors should check that the following criteria apply:

- The author is an established researcher who is familiar with the academic discourse of the subject matter for many years.
- The paper provides a well-structured overview on the topic as mentioned above and elaborates on the implications for the field of electronic markets.
- Fundamentals are not research-in-progress papers. Please do not simply submit work that you feel is premature to the Fundamentals section.
