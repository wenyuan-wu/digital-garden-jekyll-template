## Scientific Junior Track

Master/PhD students who are doing research in NLP-related fields are solicited to contribute to the Conference by submitting ongoing or finished work relevant to the NLP field. _(If you have a live demonstration, please submit to the Applied Track instead)_

_Several senior researchers in the NLP field in Switzerland have expressed their support for the initiative, and will be members of the programme committee. They will provide extensive reviews to the students to help them improve their paper writing skills._

**Submission Format:**

- - - Please use the [ACL style](https://2023.aclweb.org/calls/style_and_formatting/)
        - Language: English
        - Manuscripts for short papers (maximum of 4 pages, with the option to use additional pages for references and appendix) must describe ongoing or finished work, relevant to the NLP field. The first author must be a student registered at a Swiss academic institution. 
        - Anonymization: The review process will be double blind; we ask authors to anonymize their submission reasonably. Instead of e.g. “We previously showed (Smith, 1991) …” write “Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) …”
        - Submission will be made through [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=swisstext2024)

**Presentation Mode:**

- - - Talk during the dedicated session. It is expected that the first author (or another student author of the same paper) will present the paper at SwissText 2024. We reserve the right to convert some of the presentations to poster format should we deem it adequate.
