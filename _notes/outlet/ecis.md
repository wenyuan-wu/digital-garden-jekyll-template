### Important Dates

- Completed Research and Short Paper submission deadline: 17 November 2025, 23:59 CET (Central European Time)
- Notification of Completed Research and Short Paper (conditional) acceptance: 28 February 2026

**Completed Research Papers** must not exceed sixteen (16) single-spaced pages and must conform to the ECIS paper submission template. The page limit is all inclusive, and includes the title, body of the paper, figures and tables, references, and appendices. Submissions that exceed this limit will be automatically rejected. For empirical work, completed research papers should have completed analyses and documentation of results. Completed research papers should be similar to journal submissions, but shorter.

**Short Research Papers** must not exceed eight (8) single-spaced pages and must conform to the ECIS paper submission template. The page limit is all inclusive, and includes the title, body of the paper, figures and tables, references, and appendices. Submissions that exceed this limit will be automatically rejected.

### Originality, Plagiarism and Generative AI Tools

The submission, or a highly similar version, cannot have been published or accepted in a journal or another conference proceedings. Further, submissions must not be concurrently under consideration for publication or presentation elsewhere. Upon submission of a paper, authors must declare that they follow the AIS Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. We will follow the AIS guidelines to handle plagiarism cases. Serious cases will be considered and brought to the awareness of the AIS Research Conduct Committee. If a highly similar version of the submission exists, such as an unpublished Ph.D. thesis or early results of a study, this must be indicated in the submission as a footnote (kept anonymous to ensure a blind review process). While authors may use Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) for certain aspects of their work, such as ChatGPT assisting in editing their writing, the submissions must represent the authors’ intellectual contributions. Authors will need to disclose the use of Generative AI for any aspect of the work. You need to declare in PCS before submission: “I have used Generative AI to assist in some aspect of conducting my research or writing the paper.” If the response is “Yes”, you will be asked to describe how you have used Generative AI in your work. We look forward to receiving your ECIS 2026 submissions!

### Revision Process

Please revise your manuscript according to the editorial and review comments (see below) and submit the ‘camera-ready’ version of the paper to the conference submission system by **March 31, 2025**. Once the paper is resubmitted, the Program Chairs together with the Track Chairs will make the final decision based on the revision. The final set of papers will be published in the AIS Library.

For the revision, you need to submit four documents:

- The revised manuscript (camera ready), which strictly conforms to the formatting guidelines and requirements for ECIS 2025 proceedings as described in the Final Submission Instructions at [https://ecis2025.eu/submissions/submission-formatting-checklist/](https://ecis2025.eu/submissions/submission-formatting-checklist/). This should not have the changes marked or tracked. Please make sure to use the revision template provided on the website. Please submit this document in Word and PDF.

- A point-by-point response document to the comments by the Track Chairs (if any), the Associate Editor, and the Reviewers, describing how you have addressed the review team’s comments. In order to expedite the processing of the revised manuscript, be as specific as possible in your responses to the review team. For changes you have not incorporated as requested by the review team, please provide a clear and compelling rationale in the response document. Please submit this document in PDF.

- The revised manuscript (indicating changes), either (a) with track changes showing the changes from the previous submitted version, or (b) highlighting the changes made. Please submit this document in PDF.

Unlike your original submission, the final version needs to contain all identifying information, including author(s) details, headers, and references that may have been removed for the double-blind review process.

To submit your revised manuscript, please log in at [https://new.precisionconference.com/ais](https://new.precisionconference.com/ais) with the credentials you used to submit the original manuscript.

### Final Submission Instructions

#### General information

The deadline for final submission is **1 April, 2025**.

To submit your final submission, please log in to PCS with the credentials you used to submit the original manuscript. For the revision, you are requested to submit three documents in PDF and WORD format:

- The revised manuscript (camera ready), which conforms to the formatting guidelines and requirements for ECIS proceedings as described here and the ECIS2025 Revision Template. This should not have the changes marked or tracked.
- A point-by-point response document to the comments by the Track Chairs (if any), the Associate Editor, and the Reviewers, describing how you have addressed the review team’s comments. In order to expedite the processing of the revised manuscript, be as specific as possible in your responses to your review team. For changes you have not incorporated as requested by the Associate Editor or the Reviewers, please provide a clear and compelling rationale in the response document.
- The revised manuscript (indicating changes), either (a) with track changes showing the changes from the previous submitted version (preferred), or (b) highlighting the changes made

#### Instructions for Completed Research Papers (CRP)

The final submission for completed research papers (CRP) needs to contain all identifying information, including author(s) details, headers, and the references that were removed for the double-blind review process.

Accepted CRP will be scheduled for presentation in a session of the respective track and will be included in the conference proceedings provided that at least one author registers and attends the conference.

Final submissions for completed research papers must not exceed **sixteen** single-spaced pages and must conform to the ECIS2025 Revision Template. The page limit includes all text (including title, abstract, keywords), figures, tables, appendices, and references. Final submissions that exceed this limit will not be included in the Conference proceedings.

### Registration and Conference Format

Please note that at least one author must register for the conference by the end of the early registration period **(15 April 2025)**, to ensure the inclusion of the paper in the Conference Proceedings. Additionally, at least one author must be present at the conference and be prepared to present their paper. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in the paper being removed from the conference proceedings.

Details about the presentation of your work at the conference will be shared at a later stage. Similarly, details about conference format and registration will be available at a later stage on the website ([https://ecis2025.eu](https://ecis2025.eu)).
