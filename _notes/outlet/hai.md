#### Workshop

> Also, I am working on a workshop on the theme of Algorithmic Authority to be held in Swansea, Wales, UK on November 24. I find it would resonate with the idea of AI persuasion that you develop in your research, although we develop it with critical lenses (eg., people should not delegate/be persuaded too much!). In general I think you would like the focus of the HAI conference (Nov 24-27). We are asking for only a 500-word submission (up to 1000 words) so let me know if this may be in the cards for you within the next 25 days :) https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/algorithmicauthority/home
