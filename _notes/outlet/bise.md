**Catchwords** describe emerging technologies and important phenomena for the BISE community. Please submit your catchword article directly via the journal’s online submission tool.

Research Articles,  Research Notes, Registered Reports, and State-of-the-Art Articles need to be submitted via the journal’s online submission tool at: [http://www.editorialmanager.com/buis/](http://www.editorialmanager.com/buis/).

The typical manuscript length (including abstract and references) should be **around 20 pages**. Since we assume a constant contribution/length ratio – longer submissions are expected to have larger contributions – we also allow manuscripts (including abstract and references) with no more than **36 pages** (A4; 210×297 mm) of text (11-point Times Roman font, 1.5-spacing, justified text, margins: 25mm 25mm 20mm 25mm), and less than 15,000 words (if the manuscript is submitted in a different format). Please count every full-page illustration as 500 words.


In the abstract, please **do not use the personal form (“we”, “our”**). The abstract should answer the following questions and should be structured as follows:

- Problem definition: What is your research problem?
- Relevance: How is your research problem relevant to the IS research community and practice?
- Methodology: What is the underlying research method?
- Results: What are your key findings?
- Managerial implications: How can academics/managers/decision makers benefit from your study?

Keywords always start with a capital letter. For composite keywords **only the first word is written with capital letter**, e. g. “Enterprise resource planning”.

As an BISE author you contribute to promoting the scientific reputation in the field. We encourage authors to **reference articles in the journal** that are related and relevant to the subject matter in their article to show how the paper contributes to work and discussions in the community.

All in-text and references should be formatted following the guidelines provided by the **Springer Basic** style. The style is available in all major citation management systems such as Citavi, EndNote, or Mendeley.
