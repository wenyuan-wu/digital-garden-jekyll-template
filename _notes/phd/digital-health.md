### Digital Health and Innovation Team

Digital technologies are now integral to daily life, and the world's population has never been more interconnected. Innovation, particularly in the digital health sphere, is also happening on an unprecedented scale. Despite this, the potential of digital technologies and innovation to improve the health of populations remains largely untapped. With a coordinated approach to health products and systems innovation, there is an immense opportunity to expand their use, especially in low- and middle-income countries. WHO is harnessing the power of digital technologies and health innovation to accelerate global attainment of health and the well-being.
