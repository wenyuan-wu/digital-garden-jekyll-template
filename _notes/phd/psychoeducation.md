Psychoeducation is an evidence-based psychotherapeutic intervention that aims to develop an individual’s and their family’s knowledge and understanding of a mental health condition in order to improve their managing and coping abilities.

Psychoeducation is a simple form of therapy; it does not require practitioners to have a highly developed theoretical background, it fits easily into the clinical setting, and it targets specific therapeutic goals.
