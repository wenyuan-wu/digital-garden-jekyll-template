title: PAM - Patient Activation Measure
---

The Patient Activation Measure is a valid, highly reliable, unidimensional, probabilistic Guttman-like scale that reflects a developmental model of activation. 

Activation appears to involve four stages: 
- (1) believing the patient role is important, 
- (2) having the confidence and knowledge necessary to take action, 
- (3) actually taking action to maintain and improve one's health, and 
- (4) staying the course even under stress. The measure has good psychometric properties indicating that it can be used at the individual patient level to tailor intervention and assess changes.
